Aliens are not &quot;demons&quot;. Demons is made up term created by us. Just because you can&#39;t understand something, you call it a demon? Why is it that peoole like you are always looking for everything to be evil. You can&#39;t understand something, so you think its evil? You fear what you don&#39;t understand and what makes it worse is that you dont want to understand. So don&#39;t throw jesus at me or at anyone. He was just a man. You fill yourself with lies and you want to believe in demons and satan because the other alternative is that it would disprove everything you&#39;ve been taught and everything you believe in. So you continue to lie to yourself and try to tell people they are wrong and your right because it&#39;s in the bible. People like you piss me off. Your completely ignorant and want to stay that way. I got news for you, anyone can write a book. And the bible is thousands of years old. You ever play the game telephone? Where people go around in a circle trying to repeat what the last person said and it usually never ends up being the same word. Well thats what the bible is. A misinterpreted book thats thounsands of years old and rewritten countless times. Anyone could&#39;ve changed anything in that book. So do me a favor, if those extraterrestrials are &quot;demons&quot; and they flee when you call out the name of jesus christ, and if you ever get abducted by these &quot;demons&quot;, do me a favor and record yourself screaming the name of jesus christ so those &quot;demons&quot; don&#39;t come and get you.

And you say that satans minions are the dark spirits of hell and are also known as Extraterrestrials? And god doesn&#39;t help us because he wanta us to fight the extraterrestrial demons of hell and satan because we must learn to overcome these demons and devils? It seems you have you an extensive amount of knowledge on this subject and that you know a lot about whats going. You should go warn everyone that governmebt officiaks are actually raping children on their spare time and drawing pentagrams and sacrificing these kidnapped little children to satans evil forces and his demonic extraterrestrial minions that are evil spirits from hell and that they pretend to help us but we are actually being decieved by these evil demonic forces.  Go head, tell everyone how ignoratn you are because you are too scared of the alternative. Because you are scared that if you are wrong, everything you&#39;ve been taught was a lie and you wouldn&#39;t know what to do with yourself. Stop looking for satan and demons. Try looking for the truth instead of lying to yourself and trying to force your beliefa on others.

I have had experiences that I cant explain myself. And I use to think it had to do with ghosts, but I think its something else that I cant explain. That no one can explain. I do not believe in demons or satan. I think that we created them because we fear what we don&#39;t understand. We won&#39;t be able to understand it until we understand ourselves first. <br />   But listen, what I truly believe is that the terms heaven and hell are metaphors not meant to be taken literally. Whats going on around the world, all the hate and violence,  all the killing and fear, all the destruction. That is hell. Hell is here on earth. Heaven is the feeling you get when you first witness your child coming out of the womb. The look in that childs eyes and the love you feel for that child is heaven. Moments like these where you feel nothing but love is heaven. Hell is the worst feeling you can possibly feel. <br />   That is my explanation of heaven and hell. But when we die, its a whole different story. I believe that when we die, we all go to the same place. We go home. We bring our experiences that we had when we were alive and we learn from our mistakes and start over. Thats what I believe.

On YouTube from videos like these. I&#39;d hardly call that proof. These videos are nothing but conspiracies that if you think about it, it actually makes no sense. It may make sense to you because you think k it correlates with your religion when in reality none of these things make any sense. Btw, I didn&#39;t deny the existence of God. I do believe in God. But God is something we can&#39;t understand. God is everything and God is in all of us and all living things. God is in our consciousness and in the consciousness of all living things. In a sense, all living things is God. I&#39;m not trying to insult you or your religion. Just trying to explain to you that God is not what we have been taught to think about him. Because if that were the case, then he wouldn&#39;t be God. Does that make sense? Religion makes us feel like we know what God is about and what he does and his reasons for doing it. But if that were the case, God wouldn&#39;t be God. We can&#39;t possibly understand God until we understand ourselves and that may never happen in our lifetime or ever because we are killing each other off. All the pointless killing, fighting, hate, violence, stealing from each other, all these these things Going on around the world. How can we possibly understand anything when we keep killing each other. These extraterrestrials would have killed us already if they wanted to. But instead they come to earth to watch and observe. They abduct people for their own reasons I agree, and it&#39;s messed up what they do to people. But let me ask you this, how is it any different then what we do. What does a tiger think when he see a large metal flying machine flying over him making a very loud thundering sound? What does the tiger think we he can&#39;t move because he paralyzed by sedatives? What does the tiger think when he see these odd looking creatures walking out of that flying machine and these odd looking creatures that walk on two legs are walking towards him? What does the tiger think when these odd looking creatures on two legs Insert a chip inside and cut some skin off the tiger?. And then what does he think when when these creatures walk back in there flying machine and the sedatives wear off? How is that any different then what we do to the tiger or any animal for that matter.  That tiger thinks we&#39;re the most evil thing in the world. It thinks we&#39;re monsters or demons. How is that any different from what we do to animals. Look at it from that perspective.  Thats what we think about extraterrestrials because we don&#39;t understand them. We humans think we know more than we actually do because it&#39;s In our nature. Humans are powerful beyond measure. We can be so powerful but we limit ourselves. If you don&#39;t believe me,  the proof is in our monetary system. How is it that hundreds of people are able to control millions? How is it that we outnumber these people and disagree with everything that they do, yet we do not do anything about it? How is it that this small group of people can determine the fate of billions of people and we just accept the things that they do like sheep when we can control ourselves and our own fate instead of blindly following these people that lie to us everyday? Stop demonize  everything, because I&#39;m telling you, all religion does is demonize everything. We think it&#39;s evil if we don&#39;t understand it. I&#39;m not trying to insult you or your religion, I&#39;m trying to make a point.

{"comment": "Absolute zero is not achievable due to quantum mechanical limitation. A particle at absolute zero is not moving, which means you cloud theoretically know both where it is and how fast it is moving. This is impossible. ^_^<br /><br />Understanding temperature dynamics is a question of equilibrium. The temperature will stabilize when the heat coming in balances out against the amount of heat going out.<br /><br />Vacuum is more or less a perfect insulator. The vacuum of space isn&#39;t technically a pure vacuum, there&#39;s still <b>some</b> particles. But we can treat it as a vacuum for hypothetical purposes.<br /><br />In a perfect vacuum, the way you lose temperature is through black body radiation. If you warm anything up enough, it starts to give off radiation based on how warm it is. Radiation starts in the high wavelengths, rises up through the visible spectrum, then continues up through the ultraviolet as temperature increases.<br /><br />This is why heating elements on an electric stove glow red when they&#39;re turned on. That&#39;s black body radiation leaking up into the visible spectrum of light. Examine the heating elements of a stove with a cheap digital camera and the infra-red emissions will often become visible as blue-white light on account of cheap digital cameras not usually being configured to ignore or render infra-red light.<br /><br />So if you&#39;re in a perfect vacuum in a space suit, your body temperature will cause you to radiate black body electromagnetic waves at a frequency you cannot see. As this radiation moves out into space, your temperature will drop. This is how you lose temperature in space.<br /><br />You gain temperature in space from either an internal heating system running on a power source, or from someone shining light on you, such as from the sun. If we ignore the internal heating system and just rely on the input from the sun, then it simply becomes a question of working out what temperature the body has to be in order for the output due to black body radiation to be the same as the input from the sun. This will be the equilibrium temperature at which the amount of heat in the body will stabilize.<br /><br />The closer you are to the sun, the higher the equilibrium temperature will be. The further you are, the lower it will be.", "inReplyTo": "z12fvtpj3timfxafr23kvpgyatixevqeh", "published": 1408762999, "googlePlusUserId": "114937266578210618499", "author.name": "UbiquitousChe"}

AC kills with Voltage not amperage. A good example is when you touch one lead on a wire plugged into a wall socket,as long as you are not grounded you&#39;ll get shocked by amps not volts,if you touch both wires,you complete the circuit and get shocked by the Voltage.One volt AC can kill you in a split second,DC voltage,will not,DC amperage on the other hand will!!! A good example of this is a welding machine set on DC reverse,if you hold both leads you&#39;ll get a shock of Voltage,which is irritating but not deadly.SO unless you have a bad Heart nothing is going to happen except some tingling sensations! ;)", "inReplyTo": "z12ns3rantmls5tit04cfz0jvpi2w1rgrf4", "published": 1389626838, "googlePlusUserId": "105363463808131359192", "author.name": "B Cord Edleman Jr"}

That magnet in a Copper pipe experiment is evidence it self that magnetism plays a real part in gravitational polarities in pulling and pushings<br /><br />For example: Since space is zero point gravity, thus your weight is ZERO kilograms, and for the sake of argument, lets say that gravity is ENTIRELY based on mass relation. Now lets ask the fundamental question, why does not common things revolve around us when we are in zero point gravity space (this FACT alone contradicts that mass alone is the contributing factor in gravity)<br /><br />Now lets look at mass in an entirely different perspective, take a balloon without statically charging it and it does not attract the lower particles what so ever, now lets charge the baloon by rubbing it with our hands and see what happens, (perform \u00a0this primitive experiment to learn a fundemental law of gravity)<br /><br />This charging of polaities causes a force which in turn enables the greater mass (which is polarized) to have more control of the lower mass (which is also polarized)<br /><br />Now lets take a look at how magnetism causes polarities.\u00a0<br /><br />Here is a link to read, Quantum thory of a hydrogen atom in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field\u00a0<br /><br /><a href=\"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=qinOEULlaEsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=bare+our+atoms+polarized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nT_Es8Ps9p&amp;sig=OXKBuzkUzsBg6jT07SgqeGv_K6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OhT0U86FOYy9uASp4oHAAw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bare%20our%20atoms%20polarized&amp;f=false\">http://books.google.com.au/books?id=qinOEULlaEsC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=bare+our+atoms+polarized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nT_Es8Ps9p&amp;sig=OXKBuzkUzsBg6jT07SgqeGv_K6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OhT0U86FOYy9uASp4oHAAw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bare%20our%20atoms%20polarized&amp;f=false</a><br /><br />here is a link to\u00a0Manipulating Atoms with Photons<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.phys.ens.fr/~dalibard/publi2/New-Physics.pdf\">http://www.phys.ens.fr/~dalibard/publi2/New-Physics.pdf</a><br /><br />What you young gentlemen have to understand is there is a number of layers that are interacting with one another that plays a fundemental role in what you call gravity... Mass is merely one layer, magnetism is nother, yet there are many more and it can be altered and manipulated to create zero point gravity (anti gravity) using magnetics in a cetrain way with ferrofluid to create a vortex that generated a seperate force field thus generating a sovereign state of gravity to zero point variable", "inReplyTo": "z12pypbzlxfhihwtj22lgbaalrizituls", "published": 1408502872, "googlePlusUserId": "107948806515421339454", "author.name": "SmithsCrhronicles"}

I provided you with the video now open you eyes and look at that video from a macro and nano level of perspective<br /><br />Magnetism, nuclear force are all really the same force. It&#39;s just that under the current condition of the Universe (i.e. very cool), the one-force manifest itself in 4 different aspects: gravity, EM, strong and weak forces. But back during the Big Bang (i.e. very very hot), there was only one force.\u00a0<br /><br />However, these forces are not different now due difference in wavelengths. That&#39;s because each different type of force has their own corresponding virtual particle or wave; hence just specifying the wavelength isn&#39;t enough. You have to specify the type of particle or wave. For example, gravity has gravity waves or graviton, EM force has photons or EM waves, strong force has gluons or gluon waves.\u00a0<br /><br />Dark energy currently is hypothesized to be due to Einstein&#39;s &quot;Cosmological Constant&quot;, or vacuum energy. That is energy that exists and fills all of space everywhere, and is a basic property of empty space.\u00a0<br /><br />Science will eventually overcome all the bullshit that scientists have placed in front of it to protect their fucked up theories on major subjects.

{"comment": "According to some writers, the name of a series of hyper-secret &quot;anti-gravity&quot; crafts developped by US military &quot;black-projects&quot; uses the prefixTR which can be explained as &quot;tactical reconnaissance&quot;. To be noted that TR1A code was used for U2 1950s &quot;blackbirds&quot;, the tactical reconaissance aircraft used to spy over USSR - but this is a jet plane and of course as ultra-secret as being known to the public a decade after its appearence.\u00a0By all means in the 1950s there existed already &quot;UFOs&quot; (by that here I mean man-made anti-gravity vehicles) as these were built ever since at least the late 1930s based on Tesla&#39;s technology - note how in WWII both Americans and Germans had constructed such craft as both Allied and Nazi pilots had been harassed by the so-called &#39;&#39;foo-fighters&quot;. Which means that the TR prefix is only a popular one but not the real term the black project that develop this craft use.<br /><br />In popular UFO-logy, the TR3A and TR3B are terms used for a series of triangular-shaped UFOs seen since the 1980s. They are supposed to had been developed in the late 1970s as an evolution to the flying-disks of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Some suggest that the triangular shape was applied to avoid replicating the too-uncanny flying-disk shape (by all means the ideal shape for an anti-gravity craft is first a sphere and then a disk since it can fly to all orientations), in an era of more eyes watching and more cameras recording. Indeed if you saw one of the TR3Bs flying at a &#39;&#39;normal speed&quot; at a normal path you could mistake it for a normal jet plane from a distance.", "inReplyTo": "z122chzoryynt3e0m22mdhq41wzpefn4q04", "published": 1414287319, "googlePlusUserId": "115179327196583503143", "author.name": "TheusZeusDeus"}

In propaganda, not everything will be lies - but the best propaganda is all about telling 8-9 truths and attaching to them a big lie which cancels everything.

This could be anything, from a bird to a comet or any other cosmic event in the sky and of course it could be an uknown man-made craft. The possibility of a UFO being an alien craft is existing and acceptable but in reality this is a very small, minority case that should not be bothering us in front of all the rest much more possible cases.<br /><br />Yet while this is the reality, just check what governments do - and it is not presidents or ministers but the very SYSTEM that runs them behind the scenes :<br />On the one hand they say &#39;&#39;There does not exist anything like flying saucers&quot; and that what people see is &#39;&#39;the product of their imagination&#39;&#39;\u00a0and on the other they indirectly promote via &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;independent&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (very independent... yeah...) media that all these crafts are aliens having produced a para-mythology.<br /><br />Do you get what is going?", "inReplyTo": "z122chzoryynt3e0m22mdhq41wzpefn4q04", "published": 1416317157, "googlePlusUserId": "115179327196583503143", "author.name": "TheusZeusDeus"}

No believable witness has ever seen an alien. hundreds of thousands of people have signed reports of Unidentified Flying Objects though and millions more of people have seen them around the world - the vast majority of whom refer to ultra-fast, ultra-agile flying machines that seem to operate with a technology not known to the general public. Remember that it is the very State (and I mean the State within the state, i.e. the real center of power) that implicitly promotes the mythology of Aliens to hide in plain sight the existence of UFOs so that if you see one you are driven either to deny your own eyes and insist this does not exist, or to fall on your knees and acknowledge the &quot;greatness&quot; of an alien race that visits earth - both being erroneous by all means and this independently of any belief of ours in the possibility of alien life (statistically speaking I accept too that there have to be aliens out there - but I have no believable proof they are here now with us, UFOs are no evidence of that but rather of classified man-made crafts).<br /><br />The reality check is that these are man-made flying machines based on technology already known in the last quarter of the 19th century.

{"comment": "Guys, there is a logical problem here :<br /><br />- The possibility of existence of life in other places of the universe<br />- And the evidence of existence of UFOs (that is vehicles moving on air and \u00a0with amazing speeds and manoeuvres using a publickly uknown technology)<br /><br />...they are 2 DIFFERENT things that cannot be put on the same line.<br /><br />The fact that us the general public do not know the technolody behind these crafts seen by millions of us around the world does not mean that these necessarily have to be of an alien provenance! Nor does the insistence of people like me on the fact that these are man-made crafts moving on classified technology implies any denial of the possibility of life in other planets.<br /><br />Think of it! Even Amazon forest tribes when seeing airplanes understand that these are crafts of men with more evolved technology than theirs. Or if you insist on the alien suggestion (which I do acknowledge as a possibility but only a minority one), then at least wait until someone records an alien and brings solid proof (like we have for UFO crafts) and then speak of it. Till then, the majority hypothesis remains that these are man-made crafts on classified technology that is hidden behind a wall of propagandist lies (that UFOs do not exist or that they exist but are of little green martians...)", "inReplyTo": "z122chzoryynt3e0m22mdhq41wzpefn4q04", "published": 1418290935, "googlePlusUserId": "115179327196583503143", "author.name": "TheusZeusDeus"}

{"comment": "I was reading Jude today and came across the 14th verse. Enoch prophesied about so called Christians in the end of Days. Christ returning with his angels (the rapture)\u00a0 . We jump to the 17th verse and we are told to remember what Jesus said about these same people again referring to the end of days. Do a search on these last days, end of days, and read all the warnings to Christians. I don&#39;t believe we go through Gods Wrath. But, the Great Tribulation is for the Church. Christ will only deliver a spot less tried true through the fire bride. We will be martyred for his sake many will be deceived. Revelations the 2-3 chapter to the churches I don&#39;t care where you stand on dispensationalism. Look at the church of Philadelphia... 10. \t\t\tBecause thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. (The Church is there if the church was gone there would be no reason to keep them safe)<br />11. \t\t\tBehold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. (We read about all the trials in the end of days and again a warning.. Hold Fast, don&#39;t loose they crown) This topic is filled with warning after warning after warning to the church and Christians. Why does Christ spend so much time warning us if its not true. He says pray your not with child when this day comes. All Christians...We need to be closer then you ever thought...There is about to be a strong deception set loose on this earth that even the elect in Christ will fall to.
